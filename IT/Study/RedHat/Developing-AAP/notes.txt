Chapter 1 Developing Playbooks with Ansible Automation Platform 2

AAP2 components:
- Ansible Core
  - fundamental functionality used to run Ansible Playbooks
  - defines automation language used to write playbooks in yaml
  - provides key functions [loops,conditionals etc]
  - provides framework and basic command-line tools
  - provides in ansible-core rpm
- Ansible Content Collections
  - previously modules
  - now reorganizes into separate collections
  - made up of related modules, roles and plugins
  - ansible core is limited to a small set of modules 'ansible.builtin'
  - ansible.builtin is always available
  - collections provide flexibility to:
    - select different versions of collections
    - or different sets of collections
    - ability to update modules on a separate cadence from Ansible itself
- Ansible Content Navigator
  - new top-level tool to develop and test Ansible playbooks
  - replaces and extends earlier command-line utilities, including:
    - ansible-playbook
    - ansible-inventory
    - ansible-config
  - separates the control node [on which you run Ansible] from the automation execution environment that runs is
  - by running the playbooks in a container
- Automation Execution Environments
  - conainer images that contain AnsibleCore, AnsibleContentCollections
  - and any Python libraries, executables or other dependencies needed to run playbooks
  - default environment in AAP 2.2 provides AnsibleCore 2.13
  - and collections to provide a user experience similar to Ansible 2.9
  - you an use ansible-builder to create you own execution environments
- Automation Controller
  - formerly called Ansible Tower
  - provides central point of control to run enterprise automation code
  - in Tower, the system was both control node and execution environment
  - now separated
  - can run execution environments on remote nodes
  - communicating over the network using a feature calles automation-mesh
- Automation Hub
  - provides a way to manage and distribute automation content
  - a public service at console.redat.com provides access to Red Hat Ansible Certified Content Collections
  - that can be downloaded and used with ansible-galaxy and with automation controller
