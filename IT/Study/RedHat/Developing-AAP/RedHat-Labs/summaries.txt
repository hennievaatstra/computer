Chapter 1
Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2 simplifies development and use of Ansible Playbooks at scale, by introducing new features such as Ansible Content Collections and automation execution environments.

Automation content navigator (ansible-navigator) extends and can replace many previous Ansible commands, including ansible-playbook.

An Ansible Content Collection provides a set of related Ansible modules, roles, and plug-ins that are supported by the same group of software developers.

Automation execution environments are container images that contain a specific version of Ansible Core, Ansible Content Collections, and any Python libraries, executables, or other dependencies needed to run playbooks.

You should manage your automation content in a version control system, such as Git, which enables you to track and control changes to your automation code.

Implementing recommended practices facilitates collaboration and reduces potential problems.

Chapter 2
You can use the ansible-navigator doc --mode stdout command to access the module documentation provided by Ansible Content Collections that are available to your automation execution environment.

You can use the ansible-navigator images command to inspect automation execution environments and to list the collections and other resources and collection dependencies provided by an automation execution environment's container image.

Ansible Playbooks should use fully qualified collection names (FQCNs) to refer to modules, roles, and plug-ins provided by Ansible Content Collections.

The ansible-galaxy collection install command installs Ansible Content Collections on the local system. The --collections-path (or -p) option specifies the installation directory.

You can use the collections/requirements.yml file to list the Ansible Content Collections that are required for the project.

Automation execution environments can access the Ansible Content Collections that are installed in the collections/ subdirectory in the directory that contains the playbook.

The ee-supported-rhel8 automation execution environment is used by default by automation content navigator and automation controller, and includes selected Red Hat Certified Ansible Content Collections in addition to the ansible.builtin collection.

The ee-minimal-rhel8 automation execution environment only provides the ansible.builtin Ansible Content Collection, but you can also use Ansible Content Collections from your project's collections/ directory.

You can use the ee-29-rhel8 automation execution environment for playbooks that require Ansible 2.9.
