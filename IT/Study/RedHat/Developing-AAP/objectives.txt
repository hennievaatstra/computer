    - install them from CLI
      - by name
      - or by using a requirements.yml file

  - and select the correct one
    - for your use case

Chapter 3

  - of the automation controller component
    - of Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform
- Navigate and describe the automation controller webUI
  - succesfully launch a job
    - using a job template
    - project
    - credential
    - inventory

Chapter 4
- Browse the currents Ansible configuration
  - by using automation content navigator
- Change configuration settings
  - for automation content navigator
    - with its configuration file
  - and determine where the configuraion file is located

Chapter 5
- Describe what dynamic inventories are
  - install and use an existing script
  - or plug-in
  - as an Ansible dynamic inventory source
- Write static inventory files in YAML format
- Structure host and group variables
  - using multiple files
    - per host/group
  - use special variables
    - to override the host/port/remote_user
    - that Ansible uses for a specific host

Chapter 6
- Control automatic privilege escalation at
  - play
  - role
  - task
  - block level
- Configure tasks that can
  - run before roles
  - or after normal handlers
  - and simultaneously notify multiple handlers

Chapter 7
- Format, parse, define values
  - of variables
  - using filters
- Populate variables with data
  - from external sources
  - using lookup plug-ins
- Implement loops
  - using structures
    - other than simple lists
    - by using
      - lookup plug-ins
      - and filters
- Use filters to
  - inspect
  - validate
  - manipulate
  - variables containing networking information

Chapter 8
- Run a task for a managed host
  - on a different host
  - control whether facts gathered by that task
    - are delegated to the managed host
    - or to the other host
- Tune the number of simultaneous connections
  - that Ansible opens to managed hosts
  - and how Ansible processes group of managed hosts
    - through the play' tasks
- Tune the behavior of the 'serial' directive
  - when batching hosts for execution
  - abort the play if it fails for too many hosts
  - create tasks that run only once
    - for each batch
    - or for all hosts in the inventory

Chapter 9
- Create content collections
  - and distribute them for reuse
- Build a custom automation exec.env image
  - by using the 'ansible-builder' command
- Validate that a custom exec.env
  - works as expected
  - by testing it
  - with the ansible-navigator command
  - and then distribute it for reuse
- Run a playbook in automatino controller
  - that uses a content collection
    - in the project
  - or content provided by a specific automation exec.env
