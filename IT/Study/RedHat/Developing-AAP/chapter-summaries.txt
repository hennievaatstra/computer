Chapter 1
- AAP2 simplifies development and use of Ansible Playbooks at scale
  - by introducing Ansible Content Collections
  - and automation execution environments
- Automation content navitor == ansible-navigator
  - can extend and replace many previous Ansible commands
  - including ansible-playbook
- Ansible Content Collections provide
  - related Ansible modules, roles, plug-ins
  - supported by the same group of software developers
- Automation execution environments
  - container images
  - contain specific version of
    - Ansible Core
    - Ansible Content Collections
    - any Python library
    - executables
    - other dependencies
  - to run playbooks
- Automation content should be managed in version control system
  - such as Git
  - enables to track/control change to code
- Implement recommended practices
  - facilitates collaboration
  - reduces potential problems

Chapter 2
- ansible-navigator doc --mode stdout
  - to access the module documentation
- ansible-navigator images
  - to inspect automation execution environments
  - to list collections
  - to list other resources
- use FullyQualifiedCollectionNames
- ansible-galaxy collection install
  - to install Asnible Content Collectinos
  - --collections-paths specifies installation directory
- collections/requirements.yml
  - to list Ansible Content Collections required for the project
- Automation execution environments can access collections/ subdir
- ee-supported-rhel8 is default aee and includes builtin and collections
- ee-minimal-rhel8 provides only builtin
- ee-29-rhel8 for playbooks requiring Ansible 2.9

Chapter 3
- Automation controller provides centralized location
  - to run Ansible code
  - to review results
- Automation contoller project specifies
  - location of a Git repo
    - that stores Ansible code
    - a source contolre credential
- Automation controller job template specifies
  - inventory
  - machine credentials
  - execution environment
  - project
  - and playbook to run
  - on managed hosts
- use webUI to launch automated jobs from template
- using ansible-navigator to test playbooks in an exec.env
  - can help streamline the process
  - of setting up the playbooks
  - to run successfully
