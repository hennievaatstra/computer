Lab: Creating Roles
Create an Ansible role from an existing Ansible Playbook on workstation, and then create a playbook to apply the role to serverb.lab.example.com and serverc.lab.example.com.

Outcomes

Create a role from an existing playbook.

Create a playbook to apply the role to managed hosts.

As the student user on the workstation machine, use the lab command to prepare your system for this exercise.

This command prepares your environment and ensures that all required resources are available.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab start review-cr4
Specifications

The review-cr4 directory contains your Ansible project for this activity.

Convert the ansible-httpd.yml playbook in the project directory into a new Ansible role named ansible-httpd. The new role must be created in the /home/student/review-cr4/roles/ansible-httpd directory.

Copy any variables, tasks, templates, files, and handlers that were used in or by the playbook into the appropriate files or directories in the new role. Copy the playbook variables to the roles/ansible-httpd/defaults/main.yml file.

Update the meta/main.yml file in the role with the following content:

Variable	Value
author	Red Hat Training
description	example role for RH294
company	Red Hat
license	BSD
Edit the roles/ansible-httpd/README.md file so that it provides the following information about the role:

Remove any unused directories and files within the role.

In the project directory, write a site.yml playbook that runs the new ansible-httpd role on the managed hosts in the webdev inventory group.

Run the site.yml playbook.

Evaluation

As the student user on the workstation machine, use the lab command to grade your work. Correct any reported failures and rerun the command until successful.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab grade review-cr4
Finish

On the workstation machine, change to the student user home directory and use the lab command to complete this exercise. This step is important to ensure that resources from previous exercises do not impact upcoming exercises.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab finish review-cr4
