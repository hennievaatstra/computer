Instructions:

control node: 	workstaion.lab.example.com 

managed node: 	node1.lab.example.com
		node2.lab.example.com
		node3.lab.example.com
		node4.lab.example.com
                node5.lab.example.com

__________
 

1. Install and Configure Ansible on the control node as follows:

  * Install the required packages.
  * Create a static inventory file called /home/student/ansible/inventory as follows:
          -- node1 is a member of the dev host group
          -- node2 is a member of the test host group
          -- node3 and node4 is a member of the prod host group
          -- node5 is a member of the balancers host group
          -- The prod group is a member of the webservers host group 
  * Create a configuration file called ansible.cfg as follows:
          -- The host inventory file /home/student/ansible/inventory is defined
          -- The location of roles used in playbooks is defined as /home/student/ansible/roles
          -- The Install Ansible Content Collection location /home/student/ansible/mycollection


2. Create repo.yml for  configuring repository in all nodes.

   i) Name = baseos-internal
   Description = Baseos Description
   Url = http://content/rhel9.0/x86_64/dvd/BaseOS
   GPG is enabled.
   Gpgkey = http://content.example.com/rhel9.0/x86_64/dvd/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release
   Repository is enabled.

   ii) Name = appstream-internal
   Description = App Description
   Url = http://content/rhel9.0/x86_64/dvd/AppStream
   GPG is enabled.
   Gpgkey = http://content.example.com/rhel9.0/x86_64/dvd/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release
   Repository is enabled.


3. Create a directory 'roles' under /home/student/ansible .

  i)   Create a playbook called requirements.yml under the roles directory and download the given roles under the 'roles' directory using galaxy command under it.
  ii)  Role name should be balancer and download using this url http://content.example.com/Rhce/balancer.tgz.
  iii) Role name phpinfo and download using this url http://content.example.com/Rhce/phpinfo.tgz.


4. Create offline role named apache under roles directory.

  i)   Install httpd package and the service should be start and enable the httpd service.
  ii)  Host the web page using the template.j2
  iii) The template.j2 should contain 
       Welcome to   HOSTNAME  ON IPADDRESS
       Where HOSTNAME is fully qualified domain name.
  iv)  Create a playbook named apache_role.yml and run the role in dev group.


5. Create a playbook called roles.yml and it should run balancer and phpinfo roles.

   Use roles from Ansible Galaxy
Create a playbook called /home/admin/ansible/roles.yml
* The palybook contains a play that runs on host in the balances host group and uses the balances role.
- This role configures a service to load balance web server request between hosts in the webserver host group.
- Browsing to host in the balances host group ( for example http://node5.lab.example.com) produces the following output:
Welcome to node3.lab.example.com on 172.25.250.12
- Reloading the Browser produces output from the alternet web server:
Welcome to node4.lab.example.com on 172.25.250.13
* The Playbook contains a play the runs on hosts in webserver host group and user the phpinfo role.
- Browsing to host in the webserver host group with the URL /hell.php produces the following out[ut :
Hello PHP World from FQDN
- For example Browsing to http://node3.lab.example.com/hello.php produces the following output:
Hello PHP World from node3.lab.example.com
along with various details of the PHP configuration include the version of PHP that is installed.
- Similarly, Browsing to http://node4.lab.example.com/hello.php, produces the following output:
Hello PHP World from node4.lab.example.com
along with various details of the PHP configuration including the version of PHP that is installed
