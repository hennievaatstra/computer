Ch.1
- Containers differ from VMs by providing only the necessary runtime dependencies, such as the required application-specific libraries for a program to run, rahter, than a full operating system
- Use container images to create container instances. Container instances are executables versions of the image, and include references to networking, disks and other runtime necessities
- Podman is container engine to build and run containers on an individual host
- Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform orchestrate containers accross multiple hosts called nodes
- RHOCP is a set of modular components and services that are built on Kubernetes to add capabilities for the following features:
	- remote management
	- multiple tenants
	- increased security
	- continuous integration
	- continuous development

Ch.2
- Use 'podman run' command to start a container
- Implement container-to-container communication using Podman networks, which include the following tasks:
	- managing podman networks by using 'podman network' subcommands
	- attaching a container to a network
- Use port-forwarding to expose a containerized process to the host environmanent
- Use the 'podman stop' or 'podman kill' commands to stop a container
- Use the 'podman ps' command to list containers
- Use the 'podman cp' command to copy files into and out of containers
- Manage the lifecycle of containers by using the 'podman start,podman pause,podman restart' and other Podman commands
