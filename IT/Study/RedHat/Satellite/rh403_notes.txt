- Organizations can represent departments such as Finance, Marketing and Sales
- Locations are physical places of system installation
  - high-level like Countries
  - low-level like Cities
- Capsule servers can be assigned either by Organization of by Location
- Content related functions [mgt of products, repos, contentviews] are specific to Organizations

- Managing subscriptions and content
  - Subscription management provides organizations a method to manage their RedHat subscription information
  - Content management provides organizations a method to manage the software installed on systems
  - One of the major roles of Satellite Server is to synchronize content from the RedHat CDN to provide a local software repository of Red Hat content to subscripbed hosts
  - Satellite Server access to Red Hat Network content is governed by a subscription manifest

  - creating a Manifest
    - login to customer portal
    - navigate to Subscriptions
    - click Subscription Allocations
    - click New Subscription Allocation
      - create name
      - select type
      - select version
      - add Subscriptions
    - export Manifest
  - Importing Manifest
    - Satellite UI
    - Content > Subscriptions > Manifest
    - > Browse

  - Use the hammer command to verify Organization and Locations
    # hammer --output json organization list
    # hammer --output json location list
  - Use the hammer command to verify taht only Boston location is associated with Operations organization
    # hammer --output json location list -- organization "Operations"

Ch2 - Managing Software Life Cycles

- Content refers to software on hosts managed by Satellite
- Includes base OS, middleware services, user applications
- A Product in Satellite groups related repos together
- The correct Product is automatically enabled when you enable a Red Hat source repository
- Satellite use content synchronization to maintain an exact copy of CDN repos
- A sync plan can help automate repo synchronization
- Download policies control downloading content during content synchronization
  - On Demand	- download only metadata, packages downloaded when hosts need them
  - Immediate	- downloads metadata and packages during content synchronization
  # hammer repository list
  3 hammer repository synchronize --id 5
  3 hammer repository synchronize --id 5 --organization myorg

- A Software Development Life Cycle is composed of a number of clearly defined and distinct work phases
- like plan, desing, test, build, deliver
- these phases are called environments
- To align compute resources to environments, specify the lifecycle environment when registering each host in Satellite
- Each environment path begins with the Library environment that syncs content from available sources
- Managing Lifecycle environments from commandline
  # hammer lifecycle-environment create --organization myorg --name Dev --description "Dev env" --prior Library
  # hammer lifecycle-environment list --organization myorg
  # hammer lifecycle-environment delete -- name Deploy --organization myorg
- Content is collected in the Library lifecycle environment and the distributed directly next stages

- Publishing and Promoting Content Views
- A Content View is a defined subset of content
- made available to environments
- Deploying content from Satellite begins with the publication of the content into the Library
- A newly created content view has no content associated
- To populate the content view associate it with the repos that contain/provide the required content
- You can associate more than one repo with a content view
- Content views include repos and filters that define the content of the content view
- Any customization to the content view repos/filters requires the publication of a new version of the content view to make the chagne available
- This new version then needs to be promoted [= being deployed] to the intended lifecycle environment

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ch3 - Registering hosts

- Satellite 5	: rhn_register, rhnreg_ks	; content driven
- Satellite 6	: subscription-manger		; certificate-based and subscription driven

- subscription-manager is a useful tool to manually register a newly installed system
- use an Activation Key to apply additional configuration settings
- or a bootstrap script designed to standardize a host's software config after registration

- Preparing hosts for Satellite registration 
  . updates
  # yum update subscription-manager yum
  . download and install consumer certificate RPM from satellite server
  # yum localinstall http://satellite.example.com/pub/katello-ca-consumer-latest.noarch.rpm
- Register a host to Satellite
  . clean old registration [if any]
  # subscription-manager clean
  . register
  # subscription-manager register --org <org.label>
  - install katello-agent on the managed host
    # yum install katello-agent
- Configure the new Content Host in the Satellite GUI
- after changing the Content Host settings, force a refresh on the managed hosts to see the changes
  # subscription-manager refresh

- You can create a logical group of hosts called Host Collections
- Rather than performing actions on individual host, you can run them on a host collection

- Automating Registration of Content Hosts
- Activiation keys provide a method for automating system registration and attaching subscriptions
- You can create multiple keys and associate them with different environments and Content Views
- Activation keys can define the following properties to content hosts:
  - associated subscriptions and subscription behavior
  - available products and repos
  - a lifecycle environment and a content view
  - host collection membership
- Activation keys are only used when hosts are registered
- changes to activation keys only apply to hosts using the key in the future
  - create activiation key on command line
  # hammer activation-key create --name "Activation_Key" --unlimited-hosts --description "blah" --lifecycle-environment "Dev" \
    --content-view "Example" --organization "org"
- Associate Subscription with activiation keys so that hosts that use the activation keys are automatically attached to the associated subscriptions when they register with Satellite
  # hammer activation-key add-subscription --name "Activation_Key" --subscription-id <id> --organization "org"
- You can associate host collections with activation keys
- so that hosts that use those activation keys are automatically added to the associated host collections when they register to Satellite
- You can associate a host with multiple activation keys
- which are combined to define the host settings

- Registering a host with an Activation Key
  . prepare
  # rpm -q subscription-manager yum
  . download consumer certificate from satellite
  # yum localinstall http://satellite.example.com/pub/katello-ca-consumer-latest.noarch.rpm
  . register using an activation key
  # subscription-manager register --org "My Organization" --activationkey AK_Testkey
  . install the katello agent on the managed host
    # yum install katello-agent

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ch4 - Deploying software to hosts
- Content Views define which software versions a particular environment uses
- After you create/edit a Content View, it must be published to the Library so hosts can see it
- Each publication creates a new version of the Content View
- it can then be Promoted to the first lifecycle environment in the lifecycle path
- all associated software is the released to the environment
- content view can ONLY be promoted sequentially through an environment path

- Creating Content View filters
  - by default Content Views display all repo content
  - you can use filters to limit the range of content that is displayed
  - several filter available
    - package name or package groupname
    - erratum ID, date, type
  - you can use inclusion or exclusion logic

- Composite Content Views
- content views made up of other content views
- allows for reuse of content views and simplify content management
- a composite content view CANNOT include content views that have overlapping repos

- Managing Module Streams for RHEL8 hosts
- rhel8 brings additions in package management capabilities
  - modules
  - streams
  - profiles
- A module is a collection of packages that are installed together
- Modules resolvce dependency issues between earlier an later versions
- A module can include on or more streams, which are different versions of the software provided by the module
- A module has just one stream active at a time, by default the latest
- Modules also include profiles, which are lists of packages that suppoer a use case, eg. to deploy a minimal install
- Installing a stream wholly replaces the proviously installed stream [whether up/downgrade]
- Module Naming convention
  name:stream:version:context:architecture/profile
  - shorter versions possible
  # yum module list container-tools
  # yum module install container-tools:rhel8
- to apply the available errata for the rhel8 stream of the container-tools module:
  # yum update @container-tools:rhel8
- to find the module stream for an errata:
  # hammer erratum info --id RHSA-2019:45776
