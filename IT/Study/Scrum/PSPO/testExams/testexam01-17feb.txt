Various practices upon trending have been used to forecast progress, like burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows.

Feedback
In addition to being accountable for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the Scrum Team, the Product Owner is accountable for effective Product Backlog management, communicating the Product Goal, ordering the Product Backlog, and making the Product Backlog transparent. The Product Owner may do these things or may delegate the responsibility to others. Even if the responsibility is delegated the Product Owner remains accountable.
Question 15 of 15 True or False: The Scrum Team must choose at least one high priority process improvement item, identified during the Sprint Retrospective, and place it in the Sprint Backlog.
True
!!False
Feedback
An earlier version of the Scrum Guide prescribed the practice of placing one improvement in the Sprint Backlog. This was removed in the 2020 update to the Scrum Guide because it was felt to be too prescriptive. However, if this practice provides value to you then you should adopt it. It is simply not prescribed anymore, but can still be valuable.
