Feedback:
 The entire Scrum Team is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint, and the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint are collectively owned by the Developers. No individual Developer can claim ownership over an item as this would block communication and collaboration. The Sprint Backlog is updated by the Developers throughout the Sprint as more is learned.

Question 17:

Question 18:
 Who creates the Definition of Done?
:D.  If it is not an organizational standard, the Scrum Team must create a Definition of Done appropriate for the product.

 If the Definition of Done for an Increment is part of the standards of the organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum. If it is not an organizational standard, the Scrum Team must create a Definition of Done appropriate for the product.

Question 19:
 True or False: It is mandatory that the product Increment be released to production at the end of each Sprint.

 True or False: When multiple Scrum Teams work together on the same product, each team should maintain a separate Product Backlog.
:False
Feedback:
 Products have one Product Backlog, regardless of how many Scrum Teams are used. Any other setup makes it difficult for the Developers to determine what they should work on.

Question 23:
 Which statement best describes Scrum?
:A.  A framework for creating complex products in complex environments.
Feedback:
 Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.

Question 28:
 When many Scrum Teams are working on a single product, what best describes the Definition of Done?
:A.  All Scrum Teams must have a Definition of Done that makes their combined Increment valuable and useful.
Feedback:
