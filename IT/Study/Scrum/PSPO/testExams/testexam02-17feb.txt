Question 6 of 30 True or False: The Scrum Team must choose at least one high priority process improvement item, identified during the Sprint Retrospective, and place it in the Sprint Backlog.
True

Feedback The Daily Scrum is for the Developers. It should not be used by external stakeholders to check progress.
During Sprint Planning the Scrum Team should be crafting the Sprint Goal based on the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint. The Developers identify the necessary work to meet the Sprint Goal.
Scrum Team members do not have titles, and no sub-teams; such as testing, architecture, or operations are recognized. Accountability belongs with the Scrum Team as a whole, regardless of whether team members have specialized skills.

D.  During the Daily Scrum.
Feedback The entire Scrum Team is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint, and the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint are collectively owned by the Developers. No individual Developer can claim ownership over an item as this would block communication and collaboration. The Sprint Backlog is updated by the Developers throughout the Sprint as more is learned.
