Scrum Teams typically go through some steps before achieving a state of increased performance. Changing membership typically reduces cohesion, affecting performance and productivity in the short term.

A Scrum Team is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint, typically 10 or fewer people. Generally smaller teams communicate better and are more productive

During the Sprint, scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and the Developers as more is learned. It is important to be transparent when challenges arise since ultimately the entire Scrum Team is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment.

Scrum is meant to be implemented as prescribed in the Scrum Guide. For example, the five events in the Scrum Guide are mandatory, each event has a specific purpose.
Scrum does not eliminate the complexity that is inherent in delivering a product in todayâ€™s world, instead it offers a framework for dealing with complexity. By regularly delivering Increments of value teams gain the ability to inspect and rapidly adapt based on the feedback received.
Project Managers are not simply replaced by self-managing teams. Scrum is a framework for optimizing decision making based on the knowledge and experience of the entire team.
