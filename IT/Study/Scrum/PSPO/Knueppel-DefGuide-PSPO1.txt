Preface
Scrum offers a way of working that is breaking withc seemingly conventional wisdom. Where there used to be strict hierarchies, we are discovering ways fot teams to manage their work on their own. Where product development was divided into depoartmenst such as planning, requirements engineering, implementation, testing, documentation and release, we are discaorvering waus to build small teams taht are capable of all this. And perhaps most importantly of all, where projects used to take uears, we are now discovering ways to deliver value within a month and often even more quickly thant that.

What is this book for?
This book will grant yo an overview of the Scrum framework, provide contextt for many of its ideas and rules and provide you all the knowledge necessary to pass Scrum.org's PSM I exam. This boot sticks to the current Scrum Guide and marks additional practices explicitly, allowing you to understand what is (Core) Scrum and what are helpful things to use along-side Scrum.

How is this book structured?
Scrum.org advocates for the idea of Test-Driven-Decelopment (TDD) in software development. THis means we first define the test that our new product increment must fulfill and the work our way there.
Analogously, this book will start eacht section qith questions that prepare you for PSM I ans PSPO I.
THe book will begin by introducing why agile development, of which Scrum is hte most well-known and popular approach, is on the rise. It will then explain Scrum's roles, its events and its artifacts.
Finally, you will receiv detailed information on the Professional Scrum examinations to prepare for PSM I and/or PSPO I.

What sets this book apart?
There are a number of books on the market tahta aim to prepare you fir PSM I and/or PSPO I, some good, some rather questionable.
If you buy a car, you wish to buy it from a reputable brand at a reputablde vendor to be sure of its quality and performance. Equally, you'd want to learn Scrum from a highly knowledgeable source. Regarding Scrum.org's exams, I can say with absolute certainty that there is no PSM I and'or PSPO I preparation book by an author more familiar with the Scrum.org exams. Why? Because I have taken and passed litterally every Scrum.org exam there is.

Why pursue a Professional Scrum certification
. Professional Scrum certifications are recognized as at least among the two most valuable basic-level Scrum certifications, alongside the Scrum Alliance's Certified Scrum certifications. Due to its high passing requirements, the Professional Scrum ones are often considered the more valuale one among the two
. The Prodessional Scrum certifications are awarded by Scrum.org, which was founded and to this day is still supported by Ken Schwaber, one of the co-founders of Scrum and maintainers fo the Scrum Guide.
. Professional Scrum has the highest quality standard among the various Scrum certifications in the market. Rather than just handing you hte certification after attending a class, you have to take an exam, which has a difficult passing grade of 85%!
. Professional Scrum certifications do not require you to take a class. While attending an official Scrum.org class can be a rewarding experience, especially on the more advanced levels, you are not obligated to do so. Preparing on your own and passing the examn is sufficient.
. Once you receive you Professional Scrum certification, it will not expire and does not require the payment of renewal fees.

Preparations for PSM I and PSPO I
Basic information for each
. Duration: 60 minutes
. Number of questions: 80
. Style: multiple-choice, multi-select, true/false
. Passing score: 85%

Taking the PSM I and/or PSPO I feels like a big step, primarily due to the uncertainty of what to expect.
The average time that can be spent per question is 45 seconds, leading to a fast-paces exam that leads many to believe it will be stressful. The relatively high passing grade of 85% means that out of th 80 questions, only 12 may be answered incorrectly

After having taken and passed all Scrum.org's exams and having guided numerous people through their preparation process for PSM I and the smiliare PSPO I, I gained an understanding of how the exams are built and how to prepare for them efficiently and effectively.

All the knowledge necessary to pass the PSM I and the PSPO I exam is contained in this book. While this book is much more compact than othes you may find in the market, it contains the distilled essence of what you will need to pass the exam, without lengthy text about non-essential aspects.

To prepare properly for the exams, read the entire book carefully at least once, ideally twice. Try each time to answer the questions at the beginning of each chapter prior to reading it.

Once you have finished you reading, take advantage fo Scrum.org's Scrum Open Assessment. Each attempt on the Scrum Open contains 30 from the same pool as the PSM I questions, each Product Owner one 15 from the same pool as the PSPO I questions.

If you attempt the Scrum Open and Product Owner Open multiple times, you are very likely to find some of the same questions during your actual exams.
Knowing the answer to those questions will save you important time that you can use on other questions.
Therefore, take this preparation exam multiple times.

A good benchmark for when you are ready is:
. You pass the Scrum Open thre times in a row,
. With 100% each time,
. In under 10 minutes each (giving you 20 seconds per question on average).
. You pass the Product Owner Open three times in a row,
. With 100% eacht time,
. In under 5 minutes each (giving you 20 seconds per question on average).

The two exams share approximately 60% of their question ppols, so preparing for both before taking either exam is highly recommended. For further example questions, you can use the PSM I mock exam on my website https://Scrum-examples.info

Traditional Product Development with Waterfall
When building a new product, we often see the following happen in the organization:
The initial idea is developed and product managers are assigend. These work out the ideas of the product, conduct market research, determine overarching requiremnets and set out a roadmap for the development.
Next up, tasks are handed over th project managers, who are in charge of the day-to-day business of managing the project of building the product. Under their supervision, more detailed requirements are gathered, typically by individuals with titles such as Requirement Engineer.
Once all requirements have been gathered, Solution Architects develop a plan for technical implementation, including things like architecture and tech-stack to be used. Based on these plans, they also determine how long the development will need and what budget is necessary.
This plan is then executed by the developers, who turn the requirements into the product as defined by the plan developed by the Solution Architects.
Lastly, the final product is tested by Quality Assurance people, who verify that the product suffices the quality standards. It is then released to the users for the first time since the development process began.
Once the product is live, it is handed over to another team, responsible for its operation and maintenance.
Ths process is called waterfall development, as informations flows from one stage to the next.

Risks with Waterfall Development
Approaches like the waterdall development assume that every part of the chain works as expected, that every plan made can be executed as planned and that no changes arise. This may work well for simple problems, but for complex problems, ths is rarely the case. In each step, assumptions are made that may or may not be correct. THe larger and thus often more complex a product is, the more the risks of these assumptions compound and the more likely it is that the development effort will fail.

Complexity
When we speak of complexity, we mean a specific definition. A problem is complex if the relationship between action and reaction cannot be known in advance. Takle, for example, the development of a mobile app. The development has finished, testing is done, the app works reliably. Whether or not the market will react positively to it, whether people will bw willing to download and even pay for it, is not known. While we can take steps such as market research beforehand, there is no guarantee that releasing our app (action) will lead to a successful acceptance in the marketplace (desired reaction).

In product development, many aspects are complex: market reactions, the interactions within a team, technical problems arising throughout the development effort, and so on. In none of these cases can a definitive statement be nade beforehand. Even extensive planning cannot reasonably address complex problems.

Some problems are not only complex but also adaptive. This means that the relationship between action and reaction changes over time. A software that is released and considered user-friendly in 1999 will hardly satisfy any user 20 years later. The definition of user-friendliness has changed over time. Releasing the software (action) may have led to happy customers (reaction, old) in the last millennium, but is looked upon skeptically at best today (reaction, new).

So how does Scrum help us address complex and even complex adaptive problems?

--- End Context ---

Empiricism
Scrum's theoretical foundations lie in the idea that ou knowledge comes not from long-term planning but from experience. Rather than make long-reaching assumptions, we should make our decisions based on what we have known from experience.
Therefore, to make decisions, we need to try things, learn from the outcomes, and adjust our plans. Considering that we are dealing no only with complex adaptive problems, we take nothing for granted. Even the knowledge we gained through experiments can become obsolete, so we need to run these experiments regularly.

Empiricism requires three factors:
. Transparancy	- we need to be able to see and understand the things that are relevant
. Inspection	- we need to frequently take a look at the things that affect our work
. Adaptation	- we need to make adjustments if through inspection we gain the insight that another or new approach may be more successful

Scrum and Empiricism
Scrum is a framework built upon the idea of empiricism. It prescribes rules, roles, values, events and artifacts, all of which are designed to maximize opportunities for empiricism. Every aspect in Scrum aims towards fostering transparancy, allowing for frequent inspection and empowering adaptation.

It is important to note that while Scrum comes with prescriptions in the form of mandatory rules, roles, values, events and artifacts, it is a framework. Within Scrum, teams are free to choose whatever apporach they think is approriate. How the development takes place is left to the teams. This follows the idea that those closest to an issue generally know the most about is and are best at making the right decision.
Thus, Scrum is neiter a process nor a methodology but a framework. It provides a container within which teams can self-manage their work, including the application of processes and methodologies, as long as they do no violate the ideas of Scrum.

For people unfamiliar with Scrum, the most characteristic thing when learning about usually is that it develops products in Sprints. We will go into detail about Sprints later; at this point, it is only necessary to understand that to address complex adaptive problems, Scrum takes an iterative, incremental approach.
Incremental means that the entire product is not built completely and the shown to the users, but rather smaller, functioning version are built successively, allowing the team to gather feedback and make adjustements if necessary.
Iterative means that Scrum Teams work in cycles or iterations, called Sprints, in which planning, development, gathering feedback and process improvements are conducted. A Sprint lasts at most one month an is ofter even shorter than that.
This combination  ensures that learning is incorporated regularly, and even changing conditions are quickly detected and the team can react to them.

Furthermore, Scrum is light-weight. The entire Scrum Guide only spans 13 pages to define the entirety of Scrum. That is because Scrum prescribes only the essentials and leaves a lot of freedom to those applying the framework. This reflects Scrum's foundation in lean thinking.

Scrum Team

Question
? The roles on the Scrum Team are Product Owner, Developer and Scrum Master
? Project Manger (PM) is a possible role within a Scrum Team
? Scrum Teams are cross-functional
? The self-managing of a Scrum Team is unlimited

The Scrum Team, as a small, highly flexible and adaptive team, is described as the essence of Scrum.
Scrum Teams are usually 10 people or fewer in size to ensure that those who are port of it can communicate with each other effectively and can make necessary changes quickly. This makes Scrum Steams more agile than more conventional corporate structures, where work is split between different departments, eacht with its own management structure, to which it is difficult to make changes.

The work in the Scrum Team is devided into so-colles "accountabilities". Formerly, there were to as "roles", and throughout this book this technically now out-date terminology will be used for the sake of readability.
Scrum recognizes only the following three roles in a Scrum Team:
. The Product Owner, a single person who manages the Product Backlog and determines the direction of the product development through the Product Goal; this role may be filled as a prtim-time role by a Developer or Scrum Master, though especially the latter may not be advisable.
. The Scrum Master, a single persion who supports the Product Owner, Developers and organization in delivering high-value products by spreading Scrum; the role may be filled as a part-time role by a Developer or Product Owner, though especially the latter may not be advisable.
. The Developers, a group of people responsible for the development work, i.e., turning Product Backlog items (e.g., in the format of User Stories) into a working piece of product.

All of these roles must be filled in a Scrum Team.
There are no other roles in a Scrum Team!

A Scrum Team is characterized by three crucial aspects: cross-functionality, self-management, and shared ownhership.

- Cross-functionality	describes the ability of the Scrum Team to deliver a Done product increment without the need for external help, e.g., by database specialists or a QA departement. All skille required must be present within the team.
- Self-management	is the ability and empowerment of the Scrum Team to determine what to work on and how to do it. The Product Owner determines what Product Backlog items the team will work on, the Developers decide how they turn Product Backlog items into an increment.
To be effective in its coordination and internal communication, the team should not be too large. When there are too many people, the complexity of organizing and conducting meetings and keeping everybody synchronized becomes impractical. Therefore, the whole Scrum Team should typically consist of 10 members or fewer, including Developers, Product Owner and Scrum Master.
While not an explicit rule in the Scrum Guide, it is good practice to have teams be long-lived, meaning that the team's composition does not change frequently if not needed. If a long-term- need is identitied, the staffing of the team may be changed. However, a short-term realization that a Sprint cannong be finished would not justify adding a (temporary) new member to the team. Any change will temporarily reduce productivity, as new person needs to be worked into their position and the team dynamics need to adjust.
- Shared ownership	describes the ide that the Scrum Team as a while is responsible for the outcome. While in a waterfall, there may be sub-teams (e.g., "programmers" and "testers"), Scrum recognizes no titles and no sub-teams within the group of Developers. Everybody is collectively accountable for the  outcome of the whole team. While a person may still specialize primarily in testing, all of the Developers are responsible for testing to be conducted and have to figure out a way collectively to ensure it takes place. It is important to note that this also applies to (the lack of) internal hierarchies: Scrum Teams do not heave concepts like tech leads, team leads, or an explicit internal junior-senior-hierarchy; all members are equally responsible for the outcome and equally repsonsible for working toward common goals.
Furthermore, the Product Owner, Scrum Master and the Developers share the responsibility that the Scrum Team as a whole produces a valuable product increment.

It's important to note that self-management is not completely unlimited, but takes place within the limits set by the organization within which the development takes place. While a Product Owner decides on the priorities for development an de the Developers decide how to best implement the requirements, the Scrum Team does not usually get to decide on aspects like how many hours everybody works, their own salaries or broader corporate strategies that have direct effects on the team's work.
