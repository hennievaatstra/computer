Microsoft Azure Fundamentals Exam Ref AZ-900 3rd Edition

Introduction

The purpose of the AZ-900 exam is to test your understanding of the fundamentals of Azure.
Like the exam, this book is geared toward giving you a broad understanding of Azure itself as well as many common service and components in Azure.

Chapter 1 - Describe cloud computing
  -- chapter summary
- Increased control over your resources means a larger responsibility on your part
  Decreased control results in more responsibility on the cloud provider's part
  This is called: SHARED RESPONSIBLITY MODEL
- The PUBLIC cloud model is sometimes referred to as a MULTITENANT ENVIRONMENT.
  Multiple companies share the same infrastructure.
  VMs and other infrastructure are allocate to user as they need them, and when they no longer need them, they are returned to the pool to be used by other users.
  The network is available publicly over the internet, but you du have the ability to put security methods in place to control access to you resources.
- The PRIVATE cloud model is sometimes referre to as a SINGLE-TENANA ENVIRONMENT.
  All infrastructure is private to an individual/company, the network is only available within the private cloud itself.
  It is not exposed to the internet.
  In many cases, the infrastructure is owned by the company, but not always.
  It's possible to host a private cloud in a third-party datacenter.
- A HYBRID cloud model is a mixture of public and private cloud models.
  Often used when a company needs to use on-premises resources in a cloud application.
- Moving to the cloud can help avoid downtime
  It can also help to diagnose problems with an application
  or problems with an external system that you application uses.
- You can scale up (or 'vertically') when you want to add additional CPUs or more memory (hv: in fact creating a more powerful VM)
- You can scale out (or 'horizontally') if you want to add more VMs to handle additional load
- Cloud providers give you ways to automatically scale based on usage patterns, resource utilization, times of data
  This is referred to ELASTICITY.
- Cloud providers monitor the health of the infrastructure.
  When a VM becomes 'unhealthy', the cloud provider can automatically move you to a healthy VM without you having to anything.
  This is referred to FAULT TOLERANCE
- Cloud providers also operate across multiple data centers in defferent regions of the world.
  If a natural/any disaster happens in one region, you can switch to another, assuming you have replicated your environment in multiple regions.
  This kind of planning is called 'Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Planning'.
  Cloud providers often have features in place to make implementing a plan easy.
  This is often referred to as DISASTER RECOVERY.
- Cloud providers monitor the cloud infrastructure to detect threats and keep you resources safe and secure.
- Cloud providers offer governance features to allow you control over who can access your resources and what the can do with them
- Cloud providers offer tools that make it easy to monirot and manage your cloud resources
- Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offers infrastructure running in the cloud
  but you must maintain the OS and what's installed on that infrastructure.
  IaaS offers the most control in the cloud
  also carry the largest management burden
- Platform-as-a-Service (Paa) offloads the management of the infrastructure
  also offloads the OS and components installed on the VM's.
  You are responsible for your application.
  PaaS also offers features to add functionality to you application without having to write code.
  Development teams have a wide variety of deployment methods available
  cloud povider often automates much of that proces.
- Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) provides a hosted application
  most commonly accessed using a web browser.
  In a SaaS service, the cloud provider manages everything for you.
  You are essentially renting the software from the cloud providers.
  A big benefit of SaaS is that is makes applications easily accessible by employees in the field on any device.
  
Chapter 2 - Describe Azure architecture and services
  -- chapter summary
- Azure is organized in geographies and regions
- Regions have a region pair for high availability
- Sovereign regions account for the requirements of governments and countries

  The default domain protects against a fault in the rack
  the update domain ensures avaiability during reboots from updates
- Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) allow you tue scale VMs easily
- Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) provides desktop virtualization for running operating systems and apps using a client for
  Windows, macOS, iOS or Android
  Can also be accessed via a web browser

- Azure Virtual Networks (VNets) are used to create network environments in the cloud
  VNet peering can be used to connect two VNets to each other
  Gobal VNet peering connects VNets in separate regions
- Azure DNS allows for the management of DNS records in the cloud
  Private DNS zones are resources in a VNet
  Public DNS zone are for internet-facint resources
- Azure VPN Gateway connects you VNet to other netwroks securely
- Azure ExpressRoute connect network to you Azure Vnets using a secure connection called a CIRCUIT
  ExpressRoute can transfer at speeds up to 10 Gbps

- Single sign-on (SSO) allows users to use resources such as SharePoint and Microsoft365 withouth entering a password
- Multifactor authentication (MFA) authenticates using a combination of two or more factors 
  using something you know,
  something you have,
  something you are
- Passwordless authentication allows for authentication using a device or a security key instead of a password
- Guests users can be added to Azure AD to give them access to your Azure resources
- External users from other companies can be ginve access ot you Azure AD so they can collaborate on apps and services
- Conditional Access allows you to define policies that must be met for people to authenticate to Azure AD
- Role-based access control (RBAC) allows others a specific level of access to resources based on a role assignment
- Defense in depth ('castle doctrine') is the concept of multiple layers of defense,
  designed to protect from a breach of security
- Zero-trust is a framework that applies end-to-end security and the assumption that all access may be a breach of security
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud is a single solution
  for managing the security and regulatory compliance of Azure resources,
  resources in the cloud,
  and resources on-premises
