The following table shows some of the operations that administrators can use when working with conditionals:

OPERATION			EXAMPLE
Equal (value is a string)	ansible_machine == “x86_64”
Equal (value is numeric)	max_memory == 512
Less than			min_memory < 128
Greater than			min_memory > 256
Less than or equal to		min_memory <= 256
Greater than or equal to	min_memory >= 512
Not equal to			min_memory != 512
Variable exists			min_memory is defined
Variable does not exist		min_memory is not defined
Boolean variable is true	memory_available (The values of 1, True, or yes evaluate to true)
Boolean variable is false	not memory_available (The values of 0, False, or no evaluate to false)

First variable’s value is present as a value in second variable’s list	ansible_distribution in supported_distros
 The last entry in the preceding table might be confusing at first. The following example illustrates how it works.
