--- LIST
All members of a list are lines beginning at the same indentation level starting with a "- " (a dash and a space):

---
# A list of tasty fruits
- Apple
- Orange
- Strawberry
- Mango
...

--- DICT
A dictionary is represented in a simple key: value form (the colon must be followed by a space):

# An employee record
martin:
  name: Martin D'vloper
  job: Developer
  skill: Elite

--- MULTI LINE VALUES
Values can span multiple lines using | or >. Spanning multiple lines using a “Literal Block Scalar” | will include the newlines and any trailing spaces. Using a “Folded Block Scalar” > will fold newlines to spaces; it’s used to make what would otherwise be a very long line easier to read and edit. In either case the indentation will be ignored. Examples are:

include_newlines: |
            exactly as you see
            will appear these three
            lines of poetry

fold_newlines: >
            this is really a
            single line of text
            despite appearances
