These choices deal with the cut off filter in the ADC. It is by nature a low pass filter, as the purpose is to eliminate aliasing in the higher than bandwidth audio. The FIR filters are desirable because they have no ringing, (pre or post) and are phase accurate in the pass band. They produce less distortion in the signal than the IIR type filters. They are more intensive calculations, that is why you lose dual format recording and peak limiting functions when you use them. The choices have to do with the slope of the cutoff of the high frequencies. 1 is steep slope, 2 is gentle slope. Gentle slope will give you more accurate phase response in the high frequencies. My strategy to use them includes high sample rate (88.2khz) to put the filter outside the audible range, and the gentle slope for the lowest distortion. If you are recording at 44.1khz, you should probably use the steep slope cutoff. I hope this helps, it is a great recorder, and your choice of settings are very pertinent to the outcome of your project.
