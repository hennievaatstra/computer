### Adding a new stereo track
- Add a new track
- Right-click the big Record button on it
- Set the track's input to one of the stereo options

You can change the default for new tracks by going to Options | Preferences | Project | Track/Send Defaults and changing the "Record config" setting.

Reaper only has one type of track, as opposed to other DAWs that have specific Mono, Stereo, MIDI, Instrument or Bus tracks.
