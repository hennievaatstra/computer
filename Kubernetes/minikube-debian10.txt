How to Install Minikube on Debian 10 (Buster)

source: https://www.linuxtechi.com/install-minikube-on-debian-10/

--- Step 1)
Apply updates & install minikube dependencies
First and foremost, we need to update the system packages on our instance. To achieve this, execute the commands:

$ sudo apt update -y
$ sudo apt upgrade -y
Additionally, ensure that you have installed the necessary packages to enable you execute subsequent commands later on in this guide.

$ sudo apt install curl wget apt-transport-https -y

--- Step 2)
Install KVM hypervisor
To create virtual machines, we will need to have a hypervisor installed. In this guide, we are using KVM hypervisor. Check out this guide for more on  how to install KVM hypervisor in Debian 10

--- Step 3)
Install Minikube
Once you have the KVM hypervisor is in place, then use the wget command to download the latest Minikube library as shown.

$ wget https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
Next, copy the binary file to the /usr/local/bin path as shown

$ sudo cp minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
Be sure to assign execute permissions to the file.

$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/minikube
At this point, you can check the version of Minikube installed by running the command below. At the time of writing this guide. The latest version of Minikube is Minikube v1.15.1

$ minikube version
output of above command would be:

linuxtechi@debian-10:~$ minikube version
minikube version: v1.15.1
commit: 23f40a012abb52eff365ff99a709501a61ac5876
linuxtechi@debian-10:~$
--- Step 4)
Install kubectl tool
Kubectl is Kubernetes command-line tool that enables you to execute commands against a Kubernetes cluster. With kubectl, you can deploy applications, manage and inspect cluster resources including having a peek at the log files.

To install kubectl , you first need to download the binary file using the curl command as shown:

$ curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/`curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt`/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
Download-kubectl-Debian10

Make the binary file executable.

$ chmod +x ./kubectl
Next, move the binary file to your path as shown.

$ sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin
You can now verify the installation by running the command:

$ kubectl version -o yaml
kubectl-version-debian10

--- Step 4)
Starting Minikube
To start Minikube run the command:

$ minikube start
The command automatically select the KVM driver, downloads the virtual machine boot image and creates a Kubernetes cluster with a single node.

Minikube-Start-Debian10

You can access Minikube on the command-line by running the command

$ minikube ssh
minikube-ssh-debian10

To exit from the shell, simply run:

$ exit
To stop a Kubernetes cluster run :

$ sudo minikube stop
To view the status of Minikube, run following minikube command:

linuxtechi@debian-10:~$ minikube status
minikube
type: Control Plane
host: Running
kubelet: Running
apiserver: Running
kubeconfig: Configured
linuxtechi@debian-10:~$
Run below command to verify status of node

linuxtechi@debian-10:~$ kubectl get nodes
NAME       STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION
minikube   Ready    master   3h54m   v1.19.4
linuxtechi@debian-10:~$
To verify the status of the cluster, invoke the  command:

$ kubectl cluster-info
Some output similar to what we have will be displayed on the terminal.

minikube-cluster-info-debian10

Additionally, to get a glance at kubectlâ€™s default configuration, run the command:

$ kubectl config view
Minikube-cluster-config-view

--- Step 6)
Accessing Kubernetes dashboard
Kubernetes comes with built-in dashboard that allows you to manage your cluster. To view all the addons that come with minikube run:

$ minikube addons list
minikube-addon-list-debian10

To activate the Kubernetes dashboard, execute:

$ minikube dashboard
minikube-dashboard-debian10

This will trigger your default web browser to pop open the Kubernetes dashboard as shown below:

K8s-dashbaord-minikube-debian10

Perfect! We have successfully installed Minikube on Debian 10 and automatically created a single-node Kubernetes cluster.
